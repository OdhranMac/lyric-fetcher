This script is used to fetch lyrics from Genius.com and write to metadata for a directory of mp3 files.

To use this script, you will need to do two things:
    1) obtain an access token for Genius' API, and put that information in the 'genius_api_config.py' file. See the file for more information.
    2) insert your directory location in the 'mp3_directory' variable at the bottom of LyricFetcher.py.
